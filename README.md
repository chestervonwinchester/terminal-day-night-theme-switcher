# Day / Night Theme Switcher
# for MAC OS X Terminal

This is a couple of scripts that query google for the times of sunrise and sunset in your area, and then use this information to set the theme of all open terminal windows to "Day" or "Night" depending on the local time. Of course, "Day" and "Night" themes must exist in your Terminal app.
